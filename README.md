# Imputing_Missing_Data

In the included notebooks, I explore several missing data imputation techniques: 


1. Removing observations with missing data

2. Performing mean or median imputation

3. Implementing mode or frequent category imputation

4. Replacing missing values with an arbitrary number

5. Capturing missing values in a bespoke category

6. Replacing missing values with a value at the end of the distribution Implementing random sample imputation

7. Adding a missing value indicator variable

8. Performing multivariate imputation by chained equations Assembling an imputation pipeline with scikit-learn Assembling an imputation pipeline with Feature-engine
